Pick a secret word. Prompt the user: Show the user blank spaces
for every un-guessed letter in that word and the actual letter
for those which have been guessed correctly. Show the user a
list of previously guessed incorrect letters. Let the user enter
a new letter, then repeat. Let the user make only up to six mistakes.

If the word was "cat", the prompt should look something like:
Word: _A_
Misses: B, D
Mistakes Remaining: 4

Advanced:
Try to minimize the number of variables you save outside of
your guessing loop. I claim you can do it in two variables.
In addition to printing out the the blank spaces, try printing
out a stick figure as mistakes are made.

Extra Advanced:
Take any word.
Take it from a large dictionary. or take it from a file containing a bunch of words  ***Instead of a dictionary, you can use a list. or even more fun, take a random word from a long string by itemizing them by splitting along spaces in the string.
No errors with words that have double letters.
Have it only track two variables the whole time. Word, and all_user_guesses.
Have a hanging man wave goodbye in the closing message. Have him wave by clearing the system and updating his arm back and forth.
